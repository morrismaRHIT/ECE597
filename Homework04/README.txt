This directory only includes the etch-a-sketch program with rotary encoder 
controls.  The other parts of this homework are in ../mmap/ and ../realtime/

The etch-a-sketch encoders use eQEP1 and eQEP2.  Run encoderOverlay.sh to 
insert eQEP1 and eQEP2 device tree overlays into slots before running.

Clicking on LEDs in the matrix LED demo web page cycles through the four 
states of the LEDs (off, green, red, and both).

mmap ports in gpioThru are displayed in the program.
